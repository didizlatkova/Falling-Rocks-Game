The object of this simple game is to avoid getting hit by the bad rocks.
However, you can and should catch the red, heart-shaped ones - they make you last longer by giving you a life!
Be careful - the speed of the rocks increases with time so try to catch the green flowers - 
they reduce the speed and make your death slower and more painful! muahahahahuahuahua
